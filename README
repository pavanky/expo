This is a personal repo containing mostly useless files that I have
developed over time, for testing, using various languages and libraries.
They are far from perfect and may not even work on some machines.

They are out in the open for the following reasons.
1) Revision control is always a good thing. I can't believe I am this late!
2) I am working across multiple machines with no "server". So github it is.
3) Code review from whoever wants to. If anyone comes across it that is.

Also including a pretty permssive license for anyone who cares.
